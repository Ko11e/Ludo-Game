                This timeless game is simple to learn and provides entertainment for both kids and adults. It can be
                played by two or four players. The objective is to move your game pieces around the ludo board and reach
                the finish line to win. However, your opponents can hinder your progress by sending your pieces back to
                the starting point. If you want to learn more about the rules of the game, you can find them detailed
                below.

                    <h2>Rules for Ludo</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Ludo consists of a square board with four different colored bases in each corner. The first
                            colored space outside of each base is the start position. A path leads clockwise around the
                            board returning to a path with the same color as the base, then to the home column, which
                            leads to the center of the board.
                            There are four different colored sets of playing pieces that start off in their matching
                            bases. Each set consists of 4 playing pieces. The included die is used to govern the
                            movement of the pieces.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                        <p>2 to 4 players begin by placing their respective pieces in their bases. Each takes turns
                            throwing the die, and the player with the highest roll plays first. The players to the left
                            follow in turn going clockwise. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die to determine
                            a move. The goal of the game is to move all four of the player's pieces clockwise once
                            around the board, up the home column, and into the home triangle.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Movement</h3>
                        <p>To begin, a player must roll a six or a one to move a piece out of the base and onto the
                            start position.
                            That piece is then in play. The player cannot make any other moves until at least one piece
                            is
                            in play. This means that the first rund all players has three rolls to get a one or a six.
                        </p>
                        <p>If a player has a piece or pieces in play, they can move any one of their pieces 1 to 6
                            spaces
                            along the path according to the number they roll.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rules of the 6</h4>
                        <p>If a six is rolled, the player can choose to either move a piece out of his base onto the
                            start
                            position or move a piece that is in play.<br>
                            Anytime a six is rolled, the player gets an extra roll after his move.<br>
                            If a six is rolled three times in a row, the player loses his turn.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Landing on a shared square</h3>
                        <p>If a player's piece lands on an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to their
                            base where he must roll a six again in order move it out onto the starting square.
                        </p>
                        <p>If a player's piece (green piece, for example) lands on an opponent's piece (yellow), the
                            opponent's piece is sent back to the base where he must roll a six again in order move it
                            out
                            onto the starting square.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                        <p>When a player's piece has reached the home column of its own color, the piece continues its
                            moves toward the center to its home triangle. When a player's die roll lands its piece on
                            the
                            home triangle, that piece has completed its journey. A piece can only be moved to the home
                            triangle with an exact roll.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first player to have all four of his pieces finish their journeys WINS.
                        </p>
