## Testing 
### Start page
#### Select number of players
The start page of the game allows the user to choose the number of players, whether it's two, three, or four. Once the number of players is selected, the buttons should disappear and the corresponding number of input text-boxes should appear. Additionally, a new button should appear that signals the start of the game. This was tested by clicking on the three different buttons and seeing the response.
###### What occur
The website functioned as intended and did not display any error messages.

#### Name entered
When entering the name in the input textboxes and clicking on "Start the game the names should follow woth to the boargame page. If a namn isn't entered Player and the number of the player i enter as default. It was tested for two players where all boxes was entered and where some, no boxes was filled.
